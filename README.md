# AriAstroTools
Package to combine, divide or add spectra and images


This package provides tools to handle FITS files, such as combining multiple frames or applying arithmetic operations between them. It is designed to simplify workflows in astronomical data reduction by handling FITS-specific structures while preserving metadata integrity. With a straightforward command-line interface and modular functions, the package allows users to efficiently manipulate FITS data for tasks like image calibration, frame stacking, and custom mathematical operations such as flat correction, sky subtraction etc.

## About FITS

The **Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)** is the standard file format used in astronomy for storing, exchanging, and processing scientific data. A FITS file can contain images, tables, and metadata in a structured way, making it widely adopted for astronomical observations and data analysis.
